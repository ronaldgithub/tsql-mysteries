   JOIN ORDER (BUILD/PROBE, OUTER/INNER) & PHYSICAL OPERATOR SELECTION
   StackOverflow2013 demo script
   ============================================================================
   All queries below join a small, arbitrarily-bounded slice of Badges
   (Id BETWEEN 1 AND 5000, out of a few million rows) against the full Users
   table. That size gap makes the "right" choice obvious to a human, which is
   exactly what makes it a good demo: we force each wrong answer with join
   hints and watch cost/memory grant get worse, then compare against the
   optimizer's own free choice.

   HOW TO INSPECT EACH PLAN (SSMS):
     Ctrl+M (actual plan) or Ctrl+L (estimated plan), run/parse the statement,
     then:
       - Click the leftmost (SELECT) icon, press F4 -> "Estimated Subtree
         Cost" and (on actual plans) "Memory Grant" info.
       - Hover/click the Hash Match icon -> tooltip shows "Hash Keys Build"
         vs "Hash Keys Probe". Convention: top input edge = build, bottom
         input edge = probe.
       - Hover/click the Nested Loops icon -> top input edge = outer, bottom
         input edge = inner. The inner side's seek/scan operator will show a
         high "Number of Executions" (actual plan) equal to the outer row count.

   CAUTION: B2 (i.e. B5 below) and B4 (B7 below) deliberately force an
   inefficient plan (large table driving/building). Use the ESTIMATED plan
   (Ctrl+L) for those rather than running them for real -- B7 in particular
   asks the engine to loop over the entire Users table.

   changed -- this isolates the "which side" decision from the "which
   operator" decision above.
